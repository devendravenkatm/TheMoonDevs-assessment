## Fragmentation Assignment
### My Pick -  Fragment the UI into selective components to make it more readable.

## My Reasons:
- In this way code is fragmentedÂ into smaller, reusable components to improve maintainability, reuse, and scalability. 
- Each component focuses on a certain responsibility or UI feature, encouraging modularity and separation of concerns.
- This method improves code organization, making it easier to understand, and allows for future upgrades or extensions to the application.
- Components are stored in separate files or directories, making it easy to locate and modify them as needed.
